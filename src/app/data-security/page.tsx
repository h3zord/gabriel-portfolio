          <p>
            As part of our business activities, we work together with various
            external bodies. In some cases, it is also necessary to transmit
            personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal
            data to external bodies if this is necessary to fulfill a contract,
            if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax
            authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6
            Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transfer or if another legal basis allows
            the transfer of data. When using contract processors, we only pass
            on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract
            for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint
            processing contract is concluded.

            FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE

            basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to

            request the direct transfer of the data to another person
            responsible, this will only be done to the extent that it is
            technically feasible.

            You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
            your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this. The
            right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
          </p>
          <p>

            your personal data be restricted.
          </p>

            If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
            unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing
            instead of deletion.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to
            exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to
            demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted
            instead of being deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 (1) GDPR,
            your interests and ours must be weighed up. As long as it has not
            yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
            demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this
            data - apart from its storage - may only be used with your consent
            or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the
            rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
            important public interest of the European Union or a Member State

            provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter . Further data
            is not collected or only collected on a voluntary basis. We use this
            data exclusively for sending the requested information and will not
            pass it on to third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration
            form takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6
            Para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke your consent to the storage of
            the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the

            mailings. The data from the blacklist is only used for this purpose
            and is not merged with other data. This serves both your interest
            and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when
            sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.
            6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not limited in

            legitimate interests.
